    When I'm not gaming, working on my own project (Umbra) or working on mods, I like to make plugins. <br />
    So here they are. :D

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Quick intro
Hi! I'm Invatorzen, I've been working on Pokémon fan games since I was a kid but more seriously since I was in high-school. Starting with ROM Hacks and quickly getting overwhelmed as a kid I learned about 
fan games and heard about a kit called Pokémon Essentials. After working on my own project for a few years, I decided to start a new group project which is known as [Pokémon Umbra](https://twitter.com/PokemonUmbra). 
After another few years we decided to move to a newer kit called PSDK, which I have grown to learn and love and now make plugins for!
<br/><br/>
I'm very much an amateur dev, but I do enjoy making my own game and making these plugins in my free-time. I'm open to suggestions, but may never get to it if it's too demanding, out of my scope, or if I would never use it in my project.

## Repo Structure
You will find all my plugins hosted as separate folders in the <a href="/plugins/">plugins</a> folder.<br>
From there you can navigate to the plugin you want to download, and click the download button in the README.md!<br><br>
I also have a table of contents below:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/plugins/AutoRun_Toggle/README.md">AutoRun_Toggle</a></li>
    <li><a href="/plugins/AutoSave/README.md">AutoSave</a></li>
    <li><a href="/plugins/Better_Rivals/README.md">Better_Rivals</a></li>
    <li><a href="/plugins/Better_Time_Switches/README.md">Better_Time_Switches</a></li>
    <li><a href="/plugins/Blank_Nicknames/README.md">Blank_Nicknames</a></li>
    <li><a href="/plugins/Easy_Grottos/README.md">Easy_Grottos</a></li>
    <li><a href="/plugins/Easy_Outfits/README.md">Easy_Outfits</a></li>
    <li><a href="/plugins/Freeze_to_Frostbite/README.md">Freeze_to_Frostbite</a></li>
    <li><a href="/plugins/Gen9_HeldItem_Mechanic/README.md">Gen9_HeldItem_Mechanics</a></li>
    <li><a href="/plugins/OnScreen_Keyboard/README.md">OnScreen_Keyboard</a></li>
    <li><a href="/plugins/Physical_Special_Split/README.md">Physical/Special_Split_Switch</a></li>
    <li><a href="/plugins/Save_Checks/README.md">Save_Checks</a></li>
    <li><a href="/plugins/Substitubes_Balls/README.md">Substitubes_Balls</a></li>
  </ul>

  Anything without a README.md is the wild-west, and may still be getting a proper page.

## Installing PSDK Plugins
Installing PSDK plugins is made to be as easy as possible for users and is basically a drag and drop process.
<ol>
  <li>Download the psdkplug file you want directly from the repo or you can grab them all and download them as a zip.</li>
  <li>Drag the psdkplug files you want into your scripts folder.</li>
  <li>Run your project and the plugin manager will handle the rest!</li>
</ol>
<br/>
If any of the plugins have more instructions, it'd be indicated in their README.md!
